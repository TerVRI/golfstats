# App Store Pricing & Monetization Recommendations

This document summarizes recommended monetization strategy for the app store
submission based on current market norms and our product context (ongoing
server costs, live features, and continuous development).

## Recommended Model

**Subscription + Free Trial** is the best default.

- **Use a subscription** to cover ongoing server costs and fund continuous
  development.
- **Include a free trial (7–14 days)** to reduce purchase friction and improve
  conversion.
- **Optionally keep a free tier** to drive organic growth. If a free tier makes
  the product feel too limited, use a **trial → paywall** model instead.

## Why This Works

- **One‑time paid apps are increasingly rare** for apps with ongoing server or
  cloud requirements.
- **Subscriptions align with continued value** (sync, analytics, live updates).
- **Trials reduce hesitation** and lower refund churn.

## Suggested Structure

### Free Tier (if we keep one)

- Basic rounds / score tracking
- Limited stats history

### Pro Tier (subscription)

- Unlimited rounds
- Advanced analytics
- Watch / GPS / swing tracking
- Cloud sync, export, sharing

### Trial

- 7–14 days of full Pro access

## Pricing Bands (General Guidance)

- Typical consumer pricing: **$3.99–$9.99/month** or **$29–$79/year**
- **Annual pricing** improves retention and user perception (e.g., $49/year)
- For serious golfers, **higher annual pricing** is acceptable when value is
  clear and communicated.

## Feature Gating Guidance

Avoid language like “only for certain people.” Instead:

- Frame access as **“Pro features”**
- Keep core usage functional so the free experience does not feel crippled
- Make the Pro feature list explicit and easy to compare

## Launch Suggestion

- Offer **monthly + annual** plans
- Include a **7‑day trial**
- Keep pricing simple (avoid multiple tiers at launch)
- Consider a **launch promo** for annual plans (e.g., initial discount)

## Summary

Subscription + free trial is the market‑standard approach for apps with
ongoing server cost and continuous value. A small free tier can help growth,
but if it harms perceived value, a short full‑access trial is the safer path.
